        Thermodynamics god and the killing eyes

                I'm already repenting this. It's too hard to maintain something big and elegant. Although this is not really big, 6 files, some hundred lines (which is little for html)
                Anyway, my eyes where closed some minutes ago. I was thinking how I became so reactive and passive about the circumstances of life. Listening to an youtube video because I don't want to create anything, just have my brain completely on the standby mode.
                In a lots of times and circumstances is natural I think about how the thermodynamic god works. He demands that I go from my lowest energy state to an even lower energy state, this being a logical contradiction. Every single second.
                Did god created the universe in ticks? Sometimes doesnt feel feasible that the universe could use irrational numbers. I mean, when we divide theoretical circle circumference by its radius we get pi. Always. That's what Math god prepared for all of us. The physics god? Not so much.
                Not even a single perfect circle has passed by the universe. I mean, it can be as perfect as someone want it to be. But epsilon is always non zero, so is its corresponding delta.
                What my life really have on it? Well, my life is almost an ode to the thermodynamics laws. But by doing what I want (which I don't have control anymore), I'm not being really free.
                First because what I'm currecntly wanting is exactly what this god wants from me. Second, because I can't do what I don't want (what he doesn't want).
                That said, writing this nonsense is a challenge. An small and shy challenge to the thermodynamics god. I hope he doesn't mind but I feel he can't punish more than I'm being punished on every day basis.
                This being said, let's go to an smaller scenario. What did I really do today. Should this site have daily posts? I'd be so exhausted about it. But I'd feel prouder than I have ever feel in the latest months.
                I have to share a little secret. Everything I said from the start of this post I have thought it before, so I'm not creating something new nor am I challenging him really.
                How could I create something that really feels new? By being born again. You can rebirth yourself, and it's really simple. You just have to kill yourself first. Also nothing new.
                Well, I'll keep writing and hope a single new word can come from all this. What's been bothering me this much, is it really the ination? Actually, he doesn't want me to be bothered, it's quite the opposite.
                I'm almost thanking being unsatisfied, but that would be declare a loss. Not to him but to other enemy of mine, my selfsteem (it may have another face or another eyes, but that doesn't matter).
                Everything that goes to my brain and to my heart were once physical impulses. A lot of times are electrical impulses, which I was expected to have control of. Or at least have a tip on how to proccess them in the best way possible. I also don't.
                So, a friend of mine insisted I have to spend my attribute points on evading, and by evading he means charisma.Evading is not charisma dude, we we're talking about battle.
                But I get it, you were trying to say charisma evades bad situations. Another RPG game. I insited it's not where I want to spend my points.
                Anyway, let's concentrate on those eyes again. The only way to win over it is not fight. Not because I'm condemned to lose, but to fight and win is still losing. And fleeing is also losing.
                I have to feel pride again. I'm sure of the way it could be obtained. And it's not really hard, the bar is low right now. Still, I have an intransponible barrier made out of thin air.
                I was thinking about showing this text to other friend of mine, but he is the thermodynamic god's prayer and it's really crazy how I've been obsessed about this concept even before reading it the first time and even if he may not think much about this one interaction. Anyway, part of the thing I want is feeling okay about never being heard again.
                I can't be proud about trying to do something new right now. I've been commanded to try, it's not as if I have a choice. I need to make a single choice that lasts longer than an hour. For months I can't do this.
                I'm even afraid to write that I will try this right now. Everytime I fail these promises I feel even weaker. At the point I don't want to give up the small strength that been left on my heart.
                It's funny how I thought brain and writed heart. "Kings have honor, soldiers have bravery, and poets have heart". I like to think bravery come from the heart. It's such a stupid concept but its also kind of cool.
                Well, now it's decided, after I finish editing this post (since I wrote all the phrases as different paragraphs) I will commit to make a choice that lasts 1 hour of my life, no more, no less.
                More is better, but it'd not be so much of a real choice if I didn't do exactly how I writed.
                It's not a big step, I probably made 30 minutes lasting decisions in this meantime. But I will have control about a single hour of my life, that's what I wish.
